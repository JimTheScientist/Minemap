![Minemap logo](logo.png?raw=true "Minemap")

This is a program to replace the old amidst with a non Minecraft based one (meaning you can run it without Minecraft
installed), it is also way more efficient since it is fully multithreaded.

There are severals nice features added, you can see per layers of biome generation, find closest structures, draw circle,
area and use a ruler.


Supports all Minecraft release starting from 1.0+
